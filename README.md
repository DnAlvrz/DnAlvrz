# 👋 Hey there!

I'm a Full-Stack Developer who enjoys building things that actually make life easier. Since 2016, I’ve been working with both front-end and back-end technologies, focusing on creating clean, efficient solutions that scale.

I’m big on writing maintainable code, solving real problems, and keeping things running smoothly—whether that means designing a responsive UI or optimizing a backend service. I call it *strategic laziness*—why overcomplicate it when you can make it simple and smart?
